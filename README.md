Sample ACI Python Scripts from various presentations that I do at Cisco Live and other events, including Customer Presentations/Demos, DevNet, DevNet Express Events, Internal Training that I feel the demo should be shared, etc:

* Cisco Live Melbourne 2018: BRKDCN-2602
* Cisco Live Orlando 2018: BRKDCN-2011
* Cisco Live Barcelona 2019: BRKDCN-2011
* Cisco Live Melbourne 2019: BRKDCN-2602
* Cisco Live San Diego 2019: BRKDCN-2011

> Within each sub-directory, is the script and an additional README. It will be documented in that README what each script is expected to achieve and how to use that particular script.
